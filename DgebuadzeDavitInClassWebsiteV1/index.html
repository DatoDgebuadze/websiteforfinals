    <h1>Davit's Personal Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Few words about me!</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Davit Web developer from a tiny beautiful country Georgia. I am currently, living in Kingston,
        Ontario. I have studied at BTU- Business and Technology University, Information Technologies, Nowadays I am
        enrolled at St Lawrence College studying Computer Programming and Analysis. Throughout my life, I dedicated
        myself to programming. I have always had an interest in computers and the web. Nowadays, I specialize in Front
        end web development and offer customers a variety of front-end services, as also maintenance and update of
        back-end systems. My main principle when working on a front end is that When you're developing a page, not one
        pixel on your website should go unused.

    <p>Web Developers work on implementing visual designs and layouts, integrating graphics and content, optimizing
        website performance and capacity, and testing to ensure solid performance across any type of computer, mobile or
        device screen. No matter your exact job, if you want to become a Web Developer you would be expected to
        understand how to write code in some widely used web programming languages including JavaScript, HTML (HyperText
        Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and more.
        Front-End Web Developers typically focus on the visual and design elements of websites and can anticipate and
        fully appreciate user needs and behavior. As the name suggests, front-end (or client-side) development involves
        the programming of what will be visible to the user. Languages like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are widely used by
        Front-End Developers.

        Because front-end development is responsible for what you can see on a website, it’s often confused with web
        design. Although Front-End Developers don’t design websites, they are the link between design and technology
        that can turn an idea into an interactive web page.
